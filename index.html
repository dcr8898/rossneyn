  var story = &#39;Although trained in business and math in college, my early     &#39;+
              &#39;path lead me to the legal field, where I worked as a paralegal.&#39;+
              &#39;I found the legal process interesting, and medical malpractice &#39;+
              &#39;in particular to be fascinating, but ultimately felt it to be  &#39;+
              &#39;unrewarding.  In search of greater fulfillment, I was drawn to &#39;+
              &#39;a field that has always brought me joy and creative release in &#39;+
              &#39;my personal life: programming.  I am fascinated by the reach   &#39;+
              &#39;and scalability of the web and thrilled by the ability of      &#39;+
              &#39;software to solve complex problems and build practical things. &#39;;

    theres-a-board: &quot;An open source mentorship app initially designed around  &quot;+
                    &quot;the simple idea of matching students with student-tutors &quot;+
